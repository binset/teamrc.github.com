This Jekyll introduction will outline specifically  what Jekyll is and why you would want to use it.
Directly following the intro we'll learn exactly _how_ Jekyll does what it does.

## Overview

### What is Jekyll?

Jekyll is a parsing engine bundled as a ruby gem used to build static websites from
dynamic components such as templates, partials, liquid code, markdown, etc. Jekyll is known as "a simple, blog aware, static site generator".


Please take a look at [{{ site.categories.api.first.title }}]({{ BASE_PATH }}{{ site.categories.api.first.url }})
or jump right into [Usage]({{ BASE_PATH }}{{ site.categories.usage.first.url }}) if you'd like.
